Develop weather modeling using the quadratic model in teams of 5 using Waterfall, Iterative, Agile models
# Weather Modeling Using Quadratic Equation  
## Software Development Models: Waterfall, Iterative, and Agile

**weather modeling system** using a **quadratic equation**:

y = ax² + bx + c

The same mathematical model is implemented using three different **software development life cycle (SDLC) models**:
- Waterfall Model
- Iterative Model
- Agile Model



## Technologies Used
- Python
- math module
- matplotlib library

---

## 1. Waterfall Model – Fixed and Sequential

### Description
The Waterfall model follows a **linear and fixed approach**.  
All requirements are defined at the beginning and do not change during execution.

### Implementation Details
- Coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are fixed.
- Roots of the quadratic equation are calculated once.
- A single graph is plotted based on fixed inputs.

### Output
- Displays the roots of the quadratic equation.
- Shows one weather prediction curve.

## 2. Iterative Model – Improving in Cycles

### Description
The Iterative model develops the system in **multiple iterations**, improving results after each cycle.

### Implementation Details
- Multiple quadratic models are plotted.
- Each iteration uses refined coefficients.
- All iterations are displayed on the same graph.

### Iterations
- Iteration 1: Initial model
- Iteration 2: Improved coefficients
- Iteration 3: More refined model

## 3. Agile Model – Modular and Flexible

### Description
The Agile model focuses on **incremental development using sprints** and continuous feedback.

### Implementation Details
- Each sprint represents a small enhancement.
- The model is updated sprint by sprint.
- All sprint outputs are plotted together.

### Sprints
- Sprint 1: Basic model
- Sprint 2: Feedback-based update
- Sprint 3: Optimized model

## Graph Explanation
- X-axis: Time
- Y-axis: Weather Value
- Each curve represents a different version of the weather prediction model.
- Reference axes are included for clarity.
